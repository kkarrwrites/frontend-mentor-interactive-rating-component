I wrote this in VS Code (1.7.1.2) and tested it in Firefox (104.0.1).

If anyone has any comments regarding my JavaScript, I would really appreciate it. My JavaScript skills are still in the beginner stages, and I feel like my solution is very reflective of that. For instance, would it be more beneficial to move the functions that are inside the addEventListener and forEach methods into the global scope so that these functions can be called, if need be, elsewhere?
